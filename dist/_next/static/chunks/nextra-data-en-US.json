{"/html":{"title":"HTML: The structure of web pages","data":{"":"HTML started as a portable markup language to share academic papers with other people on the same network. Browsers were co-developed as a way to (1) fetch those files, and (2) display them.While the web has changed a lot since then, that core technologies haven't. When you navigate to a URL like google.com/foo/bar.html, the browser requests the shared file foo/bar.html from the server at google.com; if you specify a folder path without a file, the browser will automatically request index.html on your behalf (specifically, the requests google.com/foo/ and google.com/foo/index.html are the same).","a-basic-page#A basic page":"The most basic HTML page you could write looks something like this:\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <title>Demo app</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <p>Hello, world!</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\nIn this example, we're creating a page that has a single paragraph, <p>, with the text \"Hello, world!\".HTML is a subset of XML, that is to say it encodes the document as a tree of tags; tags can be <opening>, </closing>, or <both />. Every opening tag must have a closing tag, and opening and self-closing tag (what we referred to as \"both\") can have attributes that change the behavior of the tag (for example, <img width=\"800\" /> is an image with a width of 800px).A tag nested within another tag is referred to as a child, and the outer tag is referred to as the parent:\n<parent>\n  <child />\n</parent>\nBuilding on that, the entire nomenclature for family trees applies (there are grandparents, siblings, descendents, etc...)HTML documents begin with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration that tells the parser the document is HTML (much like a shebang in a scripting language), and consist of at most two children:\nhead: defining the metadata of the document (such as the tab's title)\nbody: defining the contents of the document (such as the paragraph with the text hello world to show)","tags-tags-tags#Tags, tags, tags":"If you were to only know 2 other tags beyond <html>, <title>, and <body> they would definitely be:\n<div>: an arbitrary block of content\n<span>: a way to select text within a block\nWe'll talk about both of these more in the CSS section.There are other common tags to add functionality to the page: <img> for images, <video> for videos, <textarea> for long-form text-input, but we don't need to understand those yet. There are also other tags that encode the purpose of the element: <main>, <article>, <header> (these act the same as a div, but allow bots and accessibility software to more easily read the webpage). My advice with these semantic elements is to use them where you can, but not to stress about them; there are still many, many websites that get along just fine with divs.","try-it-yourself#Try it yourself":"To play with this further, you can use a service like JSFiddle or CodePen, which injects the HTML directly into the body tag (and allows you to define CSS and JS files, but more on that later)."}},"/":{"title":"ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Tomas.","data":{"":"I have been programming for the web for 15+ years, developed reactive frontend frameworks at Facebook, and fucking love JavaScript.In that time, I've had the chance to teach a few people about frontend development; inevitably they'll ask me, \"hey, this is all great, is there anywhere I can go to read more\", or worse, \"I was doing some reading online and read an article that says {some hyperbole about how a certain framework / library / technology solves all problems}. Why don't we just use that?\" And that's when I explain three truths about the frontend ecosystem:\nIt's quickly evolving and highly volatile: what was true last year (/ month / week) may not be true today.\nIt's very hype-driven: because so few technologies have been around to stand the test of time, technology popularity is heavily influenced by marketing hype instead of robustness.\nA lot of the documentation is targeting first time programmers: For whatever reason, frontend attracts a lot of new developers, which is awesome; however, a lot of the documentation excludes context, tradeoffs, and nuance because it assumes the reader won't be able to, or care to, evaluate it themselves.\nThat last point, in particular, upsets me. I think frontend has many real engineering problems to work on, and the lack of experienced-developer-facing documentation discourages many developers from engaging with it.So that's why I'm here: I want to share frontend with you. I wanted to write a document that:\nTeaches frontend: assuming little to no background knowledge.\nTargets experienced developers: including any relevant context, trade-offs, and nuance. If you're just looking to get started, there are better documents for you.\nIs short: I've worked really hard to keep this whole thing front-to-back readable, and under 20 pages.\nPerhaps you're a backend developer dipping your toes into frontend for the first time; perhaps you're a frontend developer who wants to go deeper; perhaps, you've just always been curious. Regardless of the situation, if you've been coding for a while and want to learn more about frontend, this is for you.Lastly, two quick editorial notes:\nWhile I aim to be fair with this, I'm certainly not impartial. My goal is to pass on both my opinions and their reasoning, hopefully allowing you to bootstrap your own.\nThere is a lot to cover and this is very much a work in progress. If you feel I missed something, got it wrong, or just could have gone deeper feel free to DM me on Twitter (link in header).\nAnyway, I only have ~19 pages left, so let's dive in!"}}}
